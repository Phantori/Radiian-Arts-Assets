### Welcome to Radiian-Arts-Assets

The Assets posted here are specifically for use in Radiian-Arts BioCreationist Kit.  That being said anyone is free to do as they wish with any of these Assets.  No need to credit or anything.  All of these Assets have been created with Open-Source Software.  If you are interested in the Software that we are currently using then please see our Tools Repo: https://github.com/Radiian-Arts-Main/Radiian-Arts-Tools.  

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
